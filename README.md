## Description


The pre-work study guide is a step-by-step of how to build a website for beginners. I built this in order to help myself and others to learn how to do this. I created this by firstly building a HTML structure onto which I added some styling with CSS and finally some interactivity with JavaScript.  

 My motivation was to use this as a practice and a foundation plan where I build some knowledge of web development.

Learning by doing was the aim and it helped me learn and grasp concepts and key behaviours that I need to learn in order to build a website. It also allowed me to practice some basics so that I am ready for my Boot Camp course.

 In the future when I need help I will have this as a helpful guide.

I have learned how to access GitHub and how to manipulate VS code and how to use a terminal. I've learned basic codes and procedures to building a website.
